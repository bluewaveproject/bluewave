Hey, how did you get here? 
Hmm... Maybe you somehow discovered the secret.
Wow, that is insane. Especially considering that I thought this was a good hiding spot.
Until now, ofcourse.
Anyway, it seems like you know how to view hidden files.
So... Let me tell you something from lil' old me, the creator.

Fun fact, I had planned this on 2021. It was planned to be called "dreamer OS", then it was renam
ed three times. From "Dreamer Linux", "Blue Wave Linux", and look where we are now. On how the 
final name was created, I simply removed "Linux" from it's name because I thought it was too 
long. Development finally started on the 5th of April 2022. It started as just a fun idea to see
if I am even capable of doing it. Looking back to that day and see on how far this project of 
mine went in just a month, I am proud and impressed. I never knew that I could do something big
like this. I kept developing, placing my full effort onto this project, and I reached my dream.
Felt so damn satisfied. 

Oh, by the way, never give up. You can reach your dream one day. Trust me.
