---  BLUE WAVE OCEAN ---

Welcome to "Blue Wave", specifically the Ocean version. As mentioned during the installation process, this is the standard version of Blue Wave.
This serves as the documentation for the operating system. It will provide a simplisttic explanation on what you need to know.

-- SECTION 1: SOFTWARE --
Since this is now Linux and not Windows, you'd no longer use your usual programs from over there. Not exactly.
Wine provides support for (most) Windows apps. It serves as a compatibility layer of sorts.
Note that it is not perfect. Some programs may have bugs or some might not work at all. But for the most part it would work.

-- SECTION 2: INSTALLING PACKAGES --
Instead of searching the web for the right installation file, Linux has "package managers". 
Although you might think that the only way to install packages/software is to do so from the command line... 
Well, the answer is a no. Blue Wave Ocean provides Octopi by default.
It is used to install, upgrade, remove packages. Think of it as something similar to the Microsoft Store or Apple's App Store.

-- SECTION 3: NVIDIA DRIVERS --
Ah yes, NVIDIA. The company known for being a pain on Linux.
The default environment, Wayland, is known to have constant bugs in regards to NVIDIA GPUs.
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for owners of NVIDIA GPUs to boot into X11 by default instead of Wayland for a stable experience.

-- SECTION 4: USING EXT4 OR XFS AS THE DEFAULT FILESYSTEM --
This would be a rare occurence because anyone doing the installation process would just stick to the default filesystem (BTRFS).
But for those folks who aren't using BTRFS. You wouldn't really notice that much of a difference...
The only thing different is that automatic snapshots do not work while upgrading. Why?
Because only BTRFS supports it. That's it.

-- END --
Well, that's all you really need to know. Again, thank you for choosing Blue Wave.
