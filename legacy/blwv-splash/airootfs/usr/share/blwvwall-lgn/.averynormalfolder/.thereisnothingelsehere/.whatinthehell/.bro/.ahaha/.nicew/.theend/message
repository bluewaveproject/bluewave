Hey. You're here? Wow. I thought I was in a good hiding spot.

You know, This version (yes, the Splash version) was going to be called Minimum Lite. When the project was in it's planning stage. Why? The reason is, it was going to be called "Dreamer OS" or "Dreamer Linux". Oh, another fun fact, it was supposed to include versions that had KDE and Cinnamon. However, Those were cut off the board just for the sake of making it less complicated.
